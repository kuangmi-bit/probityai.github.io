"""F3 Missing is not clean: a record with one passage missing (verdict from probity-verify).

"Record" is probity-verify's own word for the stored report it checks against the source capture
(adapters/source_coverage.py: a selected span found in the source and not in the record returns
contradicted, selected_span_missing_from_record). The picture separates the two readers' vantages, one
panel each, divided by a thin rule:

Top panel: what a reader that trusts the record has in front of it. The record alone, its six passages packed
in a plain frame with a tab on its top edge that prints report.txt. Nothing in it is marked: a reader of the
record alone has nothing to flag. The eye stands at its left in the trusting reader's own ink (self), a page
tall, its iris set toward the record so it is seen looking at it, and a thought cloud in the same ink trails
from the eye and holds the one word it thinks: fine. No check, no pass glyph: a belief, not a verdict.
Bottom panel: what probity-verify has in front of it. The same six passages, now standing over the source
passages they came from, so the fifth place in the record is empty; nothing is drawn in it. Under it the
source capture, all seven passages, with a tab hanging from its foot that prints source.html. One straight
accent rung pairs each source passage with its record passage; the fifth rung, in loss ink, rises to the
record's foot like the others, with nothing above it: the source has the passage, the record has none to pair with.
A brace gathers both rows into the lens, which prints a receipt with a cross in the same loss ink:
contradicted, with the packet's reason line under it. The two readers stand at the same x, one per panel.
The only words are what the readers print and the two file paths the packet binds.
